# Testing (Deprecated)

> ⚠️ This skill has been superseded by the [`tdd` skill](../tdd/SKILL.md).

The reference files in `references/` are still active and linked from the `tdd` skill:

- [test-components.md](references/test-components.md)
- [test-hooks.md](references/test-hooks.md)
- [test-stores.md](references/test-stores.md)
- [test-functions.md](references/test-functions.md)
- [integration-tests.md](references/integration-tests.md)
- [e2e-tests.md](references/e2e-tests.md)
